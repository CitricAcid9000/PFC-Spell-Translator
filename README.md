This system translates the Adventure quest spell from https://centralia.aquest.com/doku.php to an easy way to store it in a file.

currently blood magic and troubadour don't work without manual typing and psionics have to be done one at a time.

How to prepare the files:

first, you go to one of the Google Docs. (for example https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z9fLS2XhxpJzvRh1yQ1w2CFyzcPZYeqR9EMsQho2tvw/edit?tab=t.0)

then, copy all of the Doc using Ctrl-A then Ctrl-C

open up a new text file in File Explorer (notepad will also work if you are in Windows) and paste the copy into the file by Ctrl-V

collect the pathway of this file. can be found by right-clicking on the file in File Explorer and selecting "copy as pathway"

How to Use:

after you run the program it will ask for a pathway which you will paste the one you found in the prep

set a destination for the file to be created. for example, you could use "C:/Magic Core Elemental" for the document in the example

will ask if it is a spell select yes unless you are copying incants

will ask for the number of spell groups if you select yes, so write down the integer number of spell groups that are listed in the document 


Special rules:

for psionics, you will have to list out the spell group names in the file in advance if you don't want to do a spell group 1 at a time for example:
1. Clairsentience
2. Metacreativity
3. Psychokinesis
