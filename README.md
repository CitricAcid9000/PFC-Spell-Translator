This system translates the Adventure quest spell from https://centralia.aquest.com/doku.php to an easy way to store it in a file.

Currently, for blood magic, you have to change the dashes to be consistent with every other spell group as well as rank 2 blood Analyst description dashes must be normal dashes, change the air magic list (6. smoke rather than 5. smoke), and troubadour doesn't work fully because it's unique secondaries.

How to prepare the files:

1. Go to one of the Google Docs. (for example https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z9fLS2XhxpJzvRh1yQ1w2CFyzcPZYeqR9EMsQho2tvw/edit?tab=t.0)
2. copy all of the Doc using Ctrl-A and then Ctrl-C
3. open up a new text file in File Explorer (notepad will also work if you are in Windows) and paste the copy into the file by Ctrl-V
4. collect the pathway of this file. can be found by right-clicking on the file in File Explorer and selecting "copy as pathway"

How to Use:

1. run the main method of the program
2.  it will ask for a pathway which you will paste the one you found in the prep
3. set a destination for the file to be created. for example, you could use "C:/Magic Core Elemental" for the document in the example
4. will ask if it is a spell select yes unless you are copying incants
4.1. will ask for the number of spell groups if you select yes, so write down the integer number of spell groups that are listed in the document 
5. will print out the information to the command line as well as into the file

Special rules:

for psionics, you will have to list out the spell group names in the file in advance if you don't want to do a spell group 1 at a time for example:
1. Clairsentience
2. Metacreativity
3. Psychokinesis
